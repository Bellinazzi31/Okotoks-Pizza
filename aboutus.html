     <h1>The Okotoks Pizza</h1>
     <div id="introduction">
       <h2>About us</h2>
       <p><strong>There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion.<br>
        We pull out all the stops, giving you the ‘wow’ flavour,<br> 
        experience and consistency you not only want, but deserve.<br> 
        Our customers keep coming back, again, again, and again.<br>
        We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta.<br>
        When we’re not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest,<br> 
        ripest and boldest ingredients,<br> 
        we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy.<br>
        From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians to crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies,<br> 
        everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.<br>
        After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary,<br> 
        Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time.<br>
        Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh,<br>
        traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern<br> 
        and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.<br>
        Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella,<br> 
        roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni,<br> 
        salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it.<br> 
        You feel good about eating it. 
        And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.<br></strong></p>
